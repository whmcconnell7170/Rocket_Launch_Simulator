# Rocket_Launch_Simulator
In this project, I hope to accomplish four things

    Establish a light framework to model a craft's ascent to orbit
        To include three levels of analysis
            Craft design
                Mass
                Staging
                Angle of attack
                dV
            Atmospheric Conditions
                Force of Gravity
                Drag
            Orbital Characteristics
                Perigee
                Apogee
                Inclination
    Allow for user-input craft variables to gamify and test different designs
    Generate graphics for important metrics
    Optimize a 'flight plan' for the most efficient orbital insertions based on input craft variables
        Read simulation properties into a record to drive metanalysis
